A data scientist, ex-engineer, and even ex-er-physicist writing about:

- Python 🐍 and Rust 🦀
- Software development 👨‍💻
- And cloud engineering ☁️

Additionally, in collaboration with [GitStopPractice], a section of this site is dedicated to **Grid Graphs** - a data-driven blog series covering Formula 1. Each blog post will delve deep into specific aspects of practice, qualifying, and the race, such as:

- Fastest laps 🚀
- Pit stop strategies 🛠
- Driver performance analysis 🏎️
- Team tactics 🏁🤝
- And much, much more! 🌟

This website primarily serves as a place for me to record useful things and improve my writing skills. At the same time I hope you find the content interesting and helpful too!
