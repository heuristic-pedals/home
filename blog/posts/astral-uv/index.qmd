## A note on `uv` not yet having a v1.0.0 release...

`uv` is under active development. Use with caution in production environments. Minor updates in `uv` may include breaking changes and new features, as per the [documentation][uv-breaking-changes]. This page will be updated regularly, but there might be differences between this page's last modified date and a `uv` version release date. Always compare these dates to spot any potential inconsistencies.

## Introduction

With knowledge in both Rust and Python, I was thrilled to learn about [`uv`] - a tool similar to [`cargo`] for Python, made using Rust!

Just like how `cargo` handles tasks in Rust, `uv` simplifies managing dependencies, creating virtual environments, and building packages in Python. Plus, it's faster than existing tools due to its Rust backend 🦀.

Over the last few months, I've been testing `uv` as an alternative to my usual choices for dependency and virtual environment management: [`venv`] + [`pip`]. This article delves deeper into `uv`, compares it with `venv` + `pip`, and highlights its unique advantages.

Please note that this article does not replace the [official `uv` documentation and getting started guide][uv-get-started]. Instead, it provides a quick summary of the main features of `uv` in one place, helping those interested in switching from traditional Python workflows to `uv`.

## Installation

To set up `uv`, it's recommended to visit the primary [setup guide][uv-install] for the most recent steps. You can choose from several methods such as:

1. Installing directly using `curl` or `wget`.
2. Using `brew` on macOS systems.
3. Obtaining it through PyPI.

## Comparing `uv` with a `venv`/`pip` workflow

To get a feel for `uv`'s capabilities, let's compare it to setting up and managing Python projects using a `venv`/`pip` approach.

A basic Python project usually needs (at least): one Python file, version control, a virtual environment, a way of sharing dependencies with others, and some form of documentation - even if just a `README.md`.

Here's a comparison between the workflows of `venv`/`pip` and `uv`:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="47.5%"}

**Using `venv`**

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Initialise `git` version control:
```bash
git init
```

4. Add a `.gitignore`:
```bash
touch .gitignore
```

5. Add a `README.md`:
```bash
touch README.md
```

6. Create a Python file:
```bash
touch main.py
```

7. Update pip:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

8. Install dependencies into the virtual environment:
```bash
pip install pandas geopandas
```

9. Write the source code.

10. Run the source code:
```bash
python main.py
```

11. Export dependencies to make the environment reproducible:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

::: {.column width="47.5%"}

**Using `uv`**

1. Setup project structure:
```bash
uv init
```

2. Install dependencies into a virtual environment:
```bash
uv add pandas geopandas
```

3. Write the source code.

4. Run the source code:
```bash
uv run main.py
```

:::

::::

Comparing the two workflows shows:

- Creating a minimal Python project using `uv` takes fewer steps. It's **more concise**.
- When setting up a project, `uv` builds the main structure automatically. This **reduces the chance of mistakes during setup** and **provides a consistent structure across projects**.
- `uv` is **faster when creating a virtual environment and installing dependencies**. It takes fractions of a second compared to several seconds for `venv`/`pip`. This speed will be beneficial, especially for larger Python packages with many dependencies to install and resolve.

The files within the directories and the dependency management methods used are different too:

**`venv` directory structure:**

```bash
.
├── .git
├── .gitignore
├── .venv
├── main.py
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

**`uv` directory structure:**

├── .gitignore
├── .python-version
├── .venv
├── main.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── uv.lock
```

:::

::::

- `uv` follows the **latest PEP standards** ([PEP 517] and [PEP 621]). This means that all project information, dependencies, and build 
settings can be managed from a single place using a [`pyproject.toml` file].
- `uv` also uses **dependency locking** with the help of an [`uv.lock`] file. Similar to a `requirements.txt` file, it records the exact state of the resolved project dependencies for better reproducibility and usability across multiple machines. Make sure you check this file into version control for 
these reasons.
- Additionally, `uv` has a `.python-version` file that sets a default Python version for the project environment. This helps with consistency between setups on different machines. However, it's not strictly necessary. `uv` will automatically resolve a suitable Python version based on the `pyproject.toml` specification. Even in this case, it can still be useful to make sure all developers use the same python version.

This basic comparison shows `uv` provides a much better way of working than the traditional `venv`/`pip` method. But what else can you do with it?

# Other `uv` features

### Installing Python

Since `uv` is not connected to Python itself, it can effectively manage and install Python distributions - similar to [`pyenv`]!

To install the latest or a specific version of Python, simply run `uv python install` or `uv python install <VERSION>`. To uninstall the latest or requested Python version, use `uv python uninstall` or `uv python uninstall <VERSION>`.

You can also list all available and installed Python versions using `uv python list`, and add the `--only-installed` flag to display only those currently installed.

:::{.callout-note}
`uv` can use any existing Python installations already on your machine [available here][uv-python-versions-search].
:::

See the [`uv` Python installation documentation page][uv-python-install] for more information.

### Use specific Python versions

Setting Python versions for a project can be done in two ways:

1. Run `uv init --python <VERSION>` to set the minimum Python version at the project setup stage (note that "minimum" refers to the [`requires-python`][pyproject-toml-python-requires] argument within the `pyproject.toml` file). This also sets the python version in the `.python-version` file if you do not optionally remove it.
2. Use `uv venv --python <VERSION>` to set the Python version during virtual environment creation.

:::{.callout-note}
You can still adjust the `requires-python` argument within the `pyproject.toml` file as needed, for example to specify a range of valid Python versions for the project.
:::

For more information, see the [uv Project Python versions documentation page][uv-python-versions]

:::{.callout-tip}

## Tips on `uv` Python versions
- If the requested Python version isn't installed, `uv` will automatically install a suitable version based on constraints. To disable this behaviour, you can [turn off auto-install][uv-turn-off-auto-install].
- Use `uv python dir` to find the Python installation directory for the project.
- For more details on how `uv` searches for, installs, and uses Python versions, see [the `uv` documentation][uv-python-versions-search].

### Working on different types of project? No problem!

Working on a Python project can have different structures depending on whether it's a web app, CLI tool, or data analysis.

Thankfully, `uv` handles this well. `uv` uses the terms "application", "package", and "library" for various project types (similar to how Cargo does for Rust). During the `uv init` stage, you can choose a type of project by adding either the `--app`, `--package`, or `--lib` flag. Here's a summary:

| `uv init` flag | Use-cases | Description |
| -- | ---- | ----- |
| `--app` | Scripts, analyses, web servers, and CLI interfaces (and similar) | A simple directory structure with a `main.py` and the other required project configuration files. |
| `--package` | Same as `--app`, but with additional focus on building/distribution | As above, but moves all Python source code into a subdirectory of `src` using the project name. Also adds additional entrypoint definitions (for CLI usage) and build/distribution information to the `pyproject.toml`. |
| `--lib` | Python modules or packages | Similar to `--package`, but without the entrypoint definition in the `pyproject.toml`. Also adds a `py.typed` to indicate that type hinting will be used (so it can be checked by type checkers). |

For more details, visit the [creating][uv-creating-projects] and [configuring][uv-configure-projects] project sections of the `uv` documentation.

### Managing dependencies

We've already seen [during the comparison with `venv`/`pip`](#comparing-uv-with-a-venvpip-workflow) the command `uv add <PACKAGE>` adds dependencies to a project. But it also allows you to group dependencies using flags like `--dev`, `--group`. For example, `uv add --dev pytest` and `uv add --group docs quartodoc` will add `pytest` to a `test` group and `quartodoc` to a `docs` group respectively. This is useful for separating out dependencies that aren't part of the core source code, reducing the number of required dependencies for the project.

You can specify exact versions of packages using `uv add <PACKAGE>==<VERSION>`, and even constrain them with typical `pip` comparator operators (e.g., `uv add "pandas>=1.0.0,<2.0.0"` ). To remove dependencies from a project, use the command `uv remove <PACKAGE>`.

For more details on managing dependencies, like those from GitHub/other sources, see the [managing dependencies][uv-managing-dependencies] section of the `uv` documentation.

### Displaying dependencies

Knowing the installed dependencies within a virtual environment can be helpful, and there are several ways to do this with `uv`.

One method is using `uv pip list`, which shows the installed dependencies in a table format (more on [the `uv` interface similar to `venv`/`pip` later][comparing-uv-with-a-venvpip-workflow]).

Another choice is `uv tree`, which displays the project dependencies as a tree/graph. An example output can be found below:
```bash
uv-test v0.1.0
├── geopandas v1.0.1
│   ├── numpy v2.2.5
│   ├── packaging v25.0
│   ├── pandas v2.2.3
│   │   ├── numpy v2.2.5
│   │   ├── python-dateutil v2.9.0.post0
│   │   │   └── six v1.17.0
│   │   ├── pytz v2025.2
│   │   └── tzdata v2025.2

│   └── shapely v2.1.0
│       └── numpy v2.2.5
└── pandas v2.2.3 (*)
(*) Package tree already displayed
```

### Keeping recorded and actual dependencies in-sync

I think this is the best feature of `uv`!

Sometimes, dependencies installed within virtual environments and their definitions in `pyproject.toml`/`requirements.txt` files can become out of sync. For example, this may happen when manually upgrading a dependency in the virtual environment using `pip`, and then forgetting to update the `pyproject.toml` file accordingly.

`uv` comes to the rescue (and not for the first time 🙂)! The command `uv sync` uses the `uv.lock` file to synchronise and resolve any dependency 
discrepancies. Even though you can manually check for discrepancies using `uv lock --check`, `uv` can also do this automatically! For example, when using `uv run` to execute python files, `uv` automatically locks and synchronises the Project environment before execution. This ensures 
everything is up-to-date before running, and the virtual environment/project configuration can no longer diverge.

For more insight on `uv`'s locking/synch-ing functionality, see the [uv documentation][uv-lock-sync].

### But I want to keep that `venv`/`pip` feel...

Tools like `venv`, `pip`, and others are widely used in the development community because they provide low-level APIs to manage every aspect of a virtual environment/dependency workflow. This also creates familiarity and dependency, making it challenging to switch to newer tools such as `uv` when they become available.

However, `uv` addresses both issues! If you're not ready to transition to the core `uv` API immediately or prefer accessing lower-level API calls provided by `venv` and `pip`, `uv` includes commands like `uv venv` and `uv pip`. These can be used to maintain compatibility with `venv`/`pip` when using `uv`. For example, `python3 -m venv .venv` becomes `uv venv .venv`, and `pip install pandas` becomes `uv pip install pandas`.

For more information on these aspects, see [the pip interface][uv-pip-interface] section of the `uv` documentation. Be sure to also check out the 
[`uv`/`pip` compatibility page][uv-pip-compatibility] for more specific details on the pip interface compared with `venv`/`pip`.

### Using CLI tools

Many Python packages and dependencies can be used as Command Line tools. For example, you can execute `pre-commit` across all files within a 
project by calling `pre-commit run --all-files`.

In the context of `uv`, this is also possible using `uvx` or `uv tool run`. Using the previous example, this becomes `uvx pre-commit run --all-files`. The main advantage of running tools with `uvx`/`uv tool run` is that `uv` ensures the project is fully synchronised before executing, just like `uv run`.

For more information on using tools with `UV`, see the [`UV` using tools documentation page][uv-tools].

### Building and Publishing

With `uv`, you can also build Python packages into source/binary distributions and upload them to a registry using the commands `uv build` and `uv publish`. This enables `UV` to support the latter stages of a development workflow, such as building and deploying a Python package to PyPI. For more details on how to do this, see the [`UV` building and publishing documentation page][uv-build-publish].

### Integrations

Finally, `uv` provides many integrations to enhance the workflow even more. Some notable integrations include:

- [pre-commit hooks][uv-pre-commit], which help ensure the project dependencies are fully up-to-date and synchronised before committing.
- [GitHub actions][uv-github-actions], for incorporating `uv` into CI/CD workflows.
- [Docker image][uv-docker], to use `uv` within containers.
- [FastAPI][fastapi], for developing FastAPI-based projects.

For a complete list of `uv` integrations, see the [integrations documentation page][uv-integrations].

# Final Thoughts

Changing virtual environment/dependency management tools is like stepping out of a pair of old slippers - they're familiar, comfortable, and it's not something you'd like to do without a very good reason. For me, this is `venv` + `pip`. However, `uv` brings that new running show vibe - fast, innovative features that are likely to be much better for you in the long term.

The notable `uv` advantages discussed on this page are:

- Improved dependency management, resolution, and synchronisation.
- A complete package: from Python installation right through to package distribution.
- Automated project setup and configuration.
- Enforcement of the latest PEP standards.

Of course others tools, like [PDM] and [poetry], offer some of these features (and different ones too). And for sure, `uv` has room for improvement, such as providing test framework integration (at least during the initial project setup). But ultimately, the rapid Rust backend, an 'all-in-one' tool, and an active development community, means `uv` is an incredibly exciting choice with lots of advantages - it's definitely worth having 'uv' in your toolkit!
