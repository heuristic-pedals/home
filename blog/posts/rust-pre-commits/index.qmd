This guide will show you how to:

::: {.intro-div}

- Add `fmt` and `clippy` components to `cargo`.
- Add `cargo` `fmt`, `clippy`, and `test` git pre-commit hooks to a rust project. 

:::

::: {.callout-warning}

## Pre-requisite Installations

- A stable rust toolchain and `cargo` (e.g. using [rustup]).

:::

## Introduction

Having code linting, formatting, and tests run automatically during CI runs is very advantageous. In particular, it helps enforce code standards and quality. From a rust perspective, having `cargo` on hand to do this is very helpful. However, executing these locally during development is a manual process, which can sometimes cause issues - as humans we forget a lot! In those cases, code could be pushed to a CI runner which then fails because there were problems when running the linter, formatter, and/or tests.

Pre-commits are renowned in many programming languages. Perhaps most notably the [`pre-commit` framework][pre-commit] itself. Pre-commit hooks can help prevent these issues by executing checks automatically before committing.

This guide explores two options for adding pre-commit hooks within rust projects - see the [Setting up pre-commit hooks](#setting-up-pre-commit-hooks) section for more details. Both rely on `cargo`'s additional components [`fmt` formatter][fmt] and [`clippy` linter][clippy], so the following section starts by showing how these can be added to `cargo`.

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## Pre-commit hooks aren't infallible...

... they rely on users to install the pre-commit hooks locally, which presents another opportunity for us humans to make mistakes (by not installing before committing, for example). In this case pre-receive hooks maybe a better option. However, pre-receive hooks [on GitHub][pre-receive-github] seem to be an Enterprise only solution 😞.

:::

## Adding `fmt` and `clippy`

`fmt` and `clippy` can be added as additional components to `cargo`. 

1. Install `fmt`:

```zsh
rustup component add rustfmt
```

2. Install `clippy`:

```zsh
rustup component add clippy
```

## Setting up pre-commit hooks

This section provides two sets of instructions for adding pre-commit hooks to rust project. [Option 1](#option-1-using-pre-commit) uses [`pre-commit`][pre-commit], which is a useful approach for those looking for an 'off-the-shelf' solution. [Option 2](#option-2-writing-own-hooks) explores writing hooks directly, meaning no additional external dependencies are required.

They add the following hooks:

| Hook | Description |
| -- | ----- |
| `cargo check` | Check source code and dependencies for compilation errors. |
| `cargo fmt` | Check source code for formatting inconsistencies. |
| `cargo clippy` | Run lints to check for common issues. |
| `cargo test` | Run whole test suite. |

::: {.callout-note}

The `cargo test` hook is only available when using [Option 2](#option-2-writing-own-hooks).

:::

### Option 1: Using `pre-commit`

### Option 2: Writing own hooks

::: {.callout-note}

The instruction in this section will work on MacOS and Linux, but not on Windows.

:::

This approach works by adding a script that executes when attempting to commit. It runs the necessary `cargo` compilation, formatting, and linting checks, then blocks the commit if an issue is detected at any stage.

The following instructions add the same `check`, `fmt`, and `clippy` pre-commit checks as shown in the [previous section](#option-1-using-pre-commit). To demonstrate the flexibility of this approach, there is a version of the script where the test suite is also executed as part of the pre-commit checks (which is not currently achievable with the previous option). Adding test suite execution is purely a design choice, trading off between execution speed and risk of any changes causing test failures on the runners. 

1. Within your git version controlled rust project directory, create a `pre-commit` file in the `.git/hooks/` directory:
```zsh
touch .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

2. Open the file, and add the following content:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## With `cargo test` hook

```sh
#!/bin/sh

set -eu

# formatting variables
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
RED='\033[0;31m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color
BOLD=$(tput bold)
NORM=$(tput sgr0)

echo "Running pre-commit checks..."

# cargo check hook
if ! cargo check --workspace
then
    echo -e "cargo check: ......... ${RED}nok${NC}"
    echo -e "${RED}Pre-commit: Issues detected when calling 'cargo check'."
    exit 1
fi

echo -e "cargo check: ......... ${GREEN}ok${NC}"

# cargo rustfmt hook
if ! cargo fmt -- --check
then
    echo -e "cargo rustfmt: ....... ${RED}nok${NC}"
    echo -e "${RED}Pre-commit: Code style issues detected with rustfmt."
    exit 1
fi

echo -e "cargo rustfmt: ....... ${GREEN}ok${NC}"

# cargo clippy hook
if ! cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
then
    echo -e "cargo clippy: ........ ${RED}nok${NC}"
    echo -e "${RED}Pre-commit: Issues detected by clippy."
    exit 1
fi

echo -e "cargo clippy: ........ ${GREEN}ok${NC}"

# cargo test hook
if ! cargo test
then
    echo -e "cargo test: .......... ${RED}nok${NC}" 
    echo -e "${RED}Pre-commit: Issues were detected when running the test suite." 
    exit 1
fi

echo -e "cargo test: .......... ${GREEN}ok${NC}"

echo -e "\n${GREEN}${BOLD}Success: ${NC}${NORM}All pre-commit checks passed ✅\n"

exit 0
```

## Without `cargo test` hook

```sh
#!/bin/sh

set -eu

# formatting variables
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
RED='\033[0;31m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color
BOLD=$(tput bold)
NORM=$(tput sgr0)

echo "Running pre-commit checks..."

# cargo check hook
if ! cargo check --workspace
then
    echo -e "cargo check: ......... ${RED}nok${NC}"
    echo -e "${RED}Pre-commit: Issues detected when calling 'cargo check'."
    exit 1
fi

echo -e "cargo check: ......... ${GREEN}ok${NC}"

# cargo rustfmt hook
if ! cargo fmt -- --check
then
    echo -e "cargo rustfmt: ....... ${RED}nok${NC}"
    echo -e "${RED}Pre-commit: Code style issues detected with rustfmt."
    exit 1
fi

echo -e "cargo rustfmt: ....... ${GREEN}ok${NC}"

# cargo clippy hook
if ! cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
then
    echo -e "cargo clippy: ........ ${RED}nok${NC}"
    echo -e "${RED}Pre-commit: Issues detected by clippy."
    exit 1
fi

echo -e "cargo clippy: ........ ${GREEN}ok${NC}"

echo -e "\n${GREEN}${BOLD}Success: ${NC}${NORM}All pre-commit checks passed ✅\n"

exit 0
```

::: {.callout-note}

The above code in step 2 is inspired by a solution posted in a [deaddabe blog][deaddabe]. This is built on by adding additional hooks and CLI formatting.

3. Make this file executable:
```zsh
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

4. Check the pre-commit hooks are working by calling:
```zsh
bash .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

5. Enjoy using rust with pre-commits 🥳
