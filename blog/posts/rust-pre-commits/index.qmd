This guide will show you how to:

::: {.intro-div}

- Add `fmt` and `clippy` components to `cargo`.
- Add `cargo` `fmt`, `clippy`, and `test` git pre-commit hooks to a rust project. 

:::

::: {.callout-warning}

## Pre-requisite Installations

- A stable rust toolchain and `cargo` (e.g. using [rustup]).

## Introduction

Having code linting, formatting, and tests run automatically during CI runs is very advantageous. In particular, it helps enforce code standards and quality. From a rust perspective, having `cargo` on hand to do this is very helpful. However, executing these locally during development is a manual process, which can sometimes cause issues - as humans we forget a lot! In those cases, code could be pushed to a CI runner which then fails because there were problems when running the linter, formatter, and/or tests.

Pre-commits are renowned in many programming languages. Perhaps most notably the [`pre-commit` framework][pre-commit] itself. Pre-commit hooks can help prevent these issues by executing checks automatically before committing.

This guide explores two options for adding pre-commit hooks within rust projects - see the [Setting up pre-commit hooks](#setting-up-pre-commit-hooks) section for more details. Both rely on `cargo`'s additional components [`fmt` formatter][fmt] and [`clippy` linter][clippy], so the following section starts by showing how these can be added to `cargo`.

## Pre-commit hooks aren't infallible...

... they rely on users to install the pre-commit hooks locally, which presents another opportunity for us humans to make mistakes (by not installing before committing, for example). In this case pre-receive hooks maybe a better option. However, pre-receive hooks [on GitHub][pre-receive-github] seem to be an Enterprise only solution ðŸ˜ž.

## Adding `fmt` and `clippy`

`fmt` and `clippy` can be added as additional components to `cargo`. 

1. Install `fmt`:

```zsh
rustup component add rustfmt
```

2. Install `clippy`:

```zsh
rustup component add clippy
```

## Setting up pre-commit hooks

### Option 1: Using `pre-commit`

### Option 2: Writing own git hooks
