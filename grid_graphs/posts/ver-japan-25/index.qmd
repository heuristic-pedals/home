Max Verstappen bagged a [surprise pole position for the 2025 Japan Grand Prix][f1-max-pole-report]
- Red Bull's first for the season. Perhaps even more surprisingly, Max didn't
set the fastest time in any sector during his pole lap. How often does this
happen and how did Max clinch pole position in Suzuka? Lets find out!

::: {.grid-graph-p}

Getting pole position without setting the fastest time in any sector seems like
a rare occurrence, right? After all, being quickest over a whole lap means the 
car and driver are doing well somewhere.

However, consistency across a lap might be more critical when tracks have big
differences between sectors. For instance, circuits with distinctive low/high
speed sections or a significant one-lap tyre performance degradation.
These situations often result in compromised car set-ups and tyre 'budget
spends', putting more pressure on drivers to minimise errors when their cars
aren't performing at their best. Let's explore this in more detail!

:::

### A brief history of pole positions without fastest sectors

::: {.grid-graph-p}

There were 159 qualifying sessions from the start of the 2018 season through to
the 2025 Japan Grand Prix. This includes all Sprint Qualifying (2021-2022) and
Sprint Shootout (since 2023) sessions, where the more conventional fastest lap
format is used to set the grid for Sprint races.

Across all of these sessions, the pole sitter did not set a fastest sector time
on 11 occasions. That suggests it tends to happen roughly 1 in 14 qualifying
sessions - quite rare indeed!

:::

::: {.callout-note}

Only fastest sector times set during Q3/SQ3 valid laps were considered.
This avoids potential biases introduced if conditions change significantly
between qualifying stages or drivers gained unfair advantages during invalidated
laps.

:::

::: {.grid-graph-p}

From a driver's perspective (see @fig-drivers), 7 different drivers have claimed
at least one pole position without setting a fastest sector time. It may be no
surprise to see Verstappen and Hamilton as the only drivers to have achieved
this feat more than once since 2018, given they have been the two most
successful drivers on the grid over this time.

##### Fun Fact

Kevin Magnussen accomplished this en route to achieving Haas's only pole
position to date, during the action packed
[2022 qualifying session at SÃ£o Paulo][f1-2022-brazil-quali-report].

:::

::: {.grid-graphs-p}

Looking at different tracks (see @fig-tracks), it seems that pole without a
fastest sectors may happen more often on tracks with more pronounced high/low
speed sector differences. Tracks like Baku, Budapest, and Yas Marina certainly
fit this bill, but it's not possible to say for sure without a more
sophisticated analysis than the exploratory investigation here
(perhaps a topic for a future post ðŸ™‚).
